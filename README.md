ðŸ“Š Z-Score Line Chart with Recharts

This project visualizes line chart data (uv and pv) using Recharts and dynamically highlights data points that are statistical outliers based on Z-scores.
âœ¨ Features

 âœ… Dual-line chart (uv and pv) rendered with recharts.

 ðŸ”´ Outliers highlighted in red when absolute z-score > 1.

 ðŸŽ¯ Z-score is calculated for each data series (uv and pv) separately.

ðŸ§® Z-Score Logic

A z-score represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. This chart calculates z-scores for uv and pv values individually and visually distinguishes values beyond Â±1 standard deviation.
